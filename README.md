Chocobo ['t?o?.k??bo?], also called Chocob, is a recurring animal in the series. Large avian creatures, chocobos roughly act as the Final Fantasy equivalent of horses, being domesticated for use as mounts, for pulling carts and carriages and for racing. Since their first appearance in Final Fantasy II, they have appeared in every game in the series in some capacity and are a mainstay and thus could be considered the series' mascot. The character Chocobo also serves as the protagonist of the Chocobo series of spin-offs.
